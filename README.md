## NUIM: Network-based utility for integrating microbiome and metabolome data

We developed NUIM, a modular, network-based framework for integrating microbiome and metabolome data systematically. NUIM consists of three modules: (1) data preparation and processing, (2) network construction, and (3) network analysis.

### Module 1: Data Preparation and Processing

This module defines the procedures required to prepare and process the input data for downstream network construction and analysis.

- Input data includes `microbial sequencing reads in FASTQ format` and `metabolite concentration table`.  
- Microbiome data processing involves the use of QIIME2 to generate a feature table and representative sequences. These outputs are subsequently processed using PICRUSt2 for functional prediction, yielding gene abundance, pathway abundance, and pathway contribution data.  
- Although metabolome data processing may vary depending on user preference and experimental design, NUIM assumes that metabolite concentrations have been appropriately processed by standard practice. For example, users may employ established platforms such as Metabox or MetaboAnalyst to perform normalization, transformation, and quality control of metabolomics data.

### QIIME2 Command Line Example

This section provides a general QIIME2 workflow for processing paired-end 16S rRNA sequencing data. The goal is to generate a feature table and representative sequences for downstream analysis in the NUIM pipeline.

```bash
# STEP 1: Import paired-end FASTQ files using a manifest file
# The manifest CSV should map sample IDs to file paths of forward and reverse reads.

qiime tools import \
  --type 'SampleData[PairedEndSequencesWithQuality]' \
  --input-path manifest.csv \
  --input-format PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33 \
  --output-path demux_reads.qza

# STEP 2: Trim primers/adapters
# Replace the primer sequences below with the ones used in your sequencing protocol.

qiime cutadapt trim-paired \
  --i-demultiplexed-sequences demux_reads.qza \
  --p-front-f <forward_primer_sequence> \
  --p-front-r <reverse_primer_sequence> \
  --o-trimmed-sequences trimmed_reads.qza

# STEP 3: Summarize read quality
# Review this visualization to determine appropriate truncation lengths for the next step.

qiime demux summarize \
  --i-data trimmed_reads.qza \
  --o-visualization quality_summary.qzv

# STEP 4: Denoise reads using DADA2
# Use the quality summary from Step 3 to choose truncation lengths and other parameters.

qiime dada2 denoise-paired \
  --i-demultiplexed-seqs trimmed_reads.qza \
  --p-trunc-len-f <truncation_length_forward> \
  --p-trunc-len-r <truncation_length_reverse> \
  --o-table feature_table.qza \
  --o-representative-sequences rep_seqs.qza \
  --o-denoising-stats denoising_stats.qza

# STEP 5: Filter low-abundance features
# Adjust minimum sample count and read frequency as appropriate for your dataset.

qiime feature-table filter-features \
  --i-table feature_table.qza \
  --p-min-samples <minimum_number_of_samples> \
  --p-min-frequency <minimum_total_frequency> \
  --o-filtered-table filtered_table.qza

# STEP 6: Rarefy the table to a uniform sequencing depth
# Use rarefaction curves to help select the sampling depth.

qiime feature-table rarefy \
  --i-table filtered_table.qza \
  --p-sampling-depth <depth_to_rarefy> \
  --o-rarefied-table rarefied_table.qza

# STEP 7: Taxonomic classification
# Use a pre-trained classifier appropriate for your 16S region (e.g., SILVA, Greengenes).

qiime feature-classifier classify-sklearn \
  --i-classifier <pretrained_classifier.qza> \
  --i-reads filtered_rep_seqs.qza \
  --o-classification taxonomy.qza

# STEP 8: Export data for PICRUSt2
# Export the final feature table and representative sequences for functional prediction.

qiime tools export \
  --input-path normalized_table.qza \
  --output-path feature-table

qiime tools export \
  --input-path rep_seqs.qza \
  --output-path dna-sequences
```

### Module 2: Network Construction

This module constructs a tripartite network linking microbial taxa, metabolic pathways, and metabolites. The network is composed of the following components:

- The microbe–pathway network is constructed from pathway contribution data, with edges representing the relative contribution of each microbe to specific pathways.  
- The pathway–pathway network is constructed using pathways identified as significant through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Edges between pathways are defined based on shared genes, and Jaccard indices represent edge weights.  
- The pathway–metabolite network is constructed by calculating pairwise correlation (e.g., Spearman or Pearson) between pathway abundance and metabolite concentrations.  
- These networks are finally integrated through connected pathway nodes to construct a multi-layered network.

### Module 3: Network Analysis

This module provides three network analyses designed to identify context-specific associations:

- The hub identification uses the Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) algorithm to identify key microbial pathways.  
- The pathfinding uses the Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the shortest path between the selected source and target nodes.  
- The node prioritization uses the Laplacian Heat Diffusion (LHD) algorithm to identify microbe-associated metabolites.
